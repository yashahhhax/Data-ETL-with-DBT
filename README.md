# Data ETL, dbt, and Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the Data ETL, dbt, and Machine Learning repository!

## Overview

This repository contains resources and code for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), data modeling with dbt, and machine learning workflows. The project is organized into the following main folders:

- **/dbt_project_old**: Contains dbt models and configurations for data transformation and analytics engineering.
- **Data-Insights**: Includes notebooks, scripts, and reports for data analysis and insights generation.
- **ETL**: Houses ETL pipelines and scripts for data ingestion and preprocessing.

## Features
